# Key Requirements for EventBugAI

1. Users must be able to register with unique usernames and IDs.
2. Events must have a title, description, location, and date, and cannot be scheduled in the past.
3. Users can join public events and be invited to private events, but event creators cannot leave their own events.
4. All authenticated endpoints require a valid JWT token, and users can only modify their own profile and events.
5. The system must track user engagement metrics, event participation, and generate statistics for both individual users and the overall platform.
